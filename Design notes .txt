TSSP4056 used for receiving 
Center Frequency at 56 KHz. 

Assumed to use Atmega328P (arduino Chip) Seems to be using 16MHz clock, should be 8MHz 


If Design the operation from 50Khz to 20Khz . 

	Since serial seems to have their own timer (SPI or UART) 
	using timer1 is preferred for more precision in frequency. 

	8Mhz oscillator speed, with fuse divide it by 8 

		1MHz clock speed. 

		1MHz / 50KHz = 20 
		1MHz / 20KHz = 50

		In Fast PWM mode, this means the top is 20 to 50. 
		with a various of 30, which is a little less than 5 bit 


	if 8MHz without fuse divide it by 8 // these need 16 bit timer. 8 bit cap at 255
		8MHz / 50 = 160 
		8MHz / 20 = 400 
		the top could is 160 to 400
		various for about 240, bit less than 8bit.
